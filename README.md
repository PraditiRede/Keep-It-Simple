# Keep-It-Simple

This is my team's try at a ML, NLP problem statement for the Sadda Hack hackathon conducted by IEEE IIIT-Delhi.

When we search through tabs on google chrome while learning something new, we tend of copy and paste important notes or lines or manually write them down in short words for future reference. While doing this, we have to switch between tabs for copying and pasting each and every line. This gets annoying and distracting at times.

Did you ever think what if we could develop a model that reduces this amount of time we waste in switching tabs ?

If you are thinking about it, that is what we have developed !!

A model that copies the texts we want with help of a self-created keyboard shortcut (Ctrl + K) which pastes the multiline texts into a text file. On clicking the ‘Save Text To File’ button, a text file is automatically downloaded on your device. The extension jumps to the python code that summarizes the various lines into a meaningful summarized paragraph which can be understood easily without much efforts and can be stored for future reference.

NOTE: In order to see the demonstration, kindly note that you will have to download the above file and create the chrome extension and run. 

For creating a chrome extension
Open chrome--> Menu--> More tools--> Extensions--> Upload the file
Shortcuts--> Choose your favourite shortcut
